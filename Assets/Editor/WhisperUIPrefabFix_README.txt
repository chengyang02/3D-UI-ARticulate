FIXING CORRUPTED WHISPERUI PREFAB
===============================

The WhisperUI.prefab file has duplicate identifiers, likely caused by a merge conflict. 
To fix this issue, follow these steps:

1. Open Unity Editor
2. Go to the top menu bar and select Tools > Regenerate WhisperUI Prefab
3. This will create a fresh WhisperUI prefab in the Assets/Prefabs folder

The script creates a clean version of the prefab with all necessary components:
- Canvas setup
- WhisperManager component
- UndoRedoManager component with connected Undo/Redo buttons
- Transcript display area
- Record button

TROUBLESHOOTING UNDO/REDO FUNCTIONALITY
=======================================

If the Undo/Redo buttons don't work as expected, here are some troubleshooting steps:

1. First, make sure an ActionExecutioner component exists in your scene. This is required for
   the undo/redo functionality to work.

2. Create a debug version of the prefab:
   - Go to Tools > Regenerate WhisperUI Prefab (Debug Mode)
   - This adds the UndoRedoVerifier component that outputs diagnostics to the console

3. Check the Unity Console for errors or warnings:
   - Look for messages from UndoRedoVerifier and UndoRedoManager
   - These will indicate if the button connections are properly set up

4. Common issues:
   - ActionExecutioner.Instance is null: Make sure the ActionExecutioner exists in the scene
   - No button listeners: Check if UndoRedoManager's Start method is being called
   - Commands not being saved: Verify ActionExecutioner.AddToHistory is being called properly

5. To manually test if undo/redo is functioning:
   - Perform an action (move an object, change a color, etc.)
   - Check the console for "Added command to history" messages
   - Try using keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+Z for Undo, Ctrl+Y for Redo)

If you had any custom modifications to the prefab, you may need to add them back manually.

Technical Details:
-----------------
The error "Duplicate identifier 9039941807451030831" occurs when a prefab contains multiple GameObjects 
with the same internal identifier. This can happen during merge conflicts or when 
the prefab file is modified outside of Unity.

The script creates a brand new prefab without any conflicting identifiers, resolving the issue.
